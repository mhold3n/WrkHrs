CHEMICAL REACTIONS DATABASE
===========================

COMBUSTION REACTIONS
-------------------

Methane Combustion:
CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O
ΔH = -890.3 kJ/mol
Complete combustion of methane produces carbon dioxide and water. This is the primary reaction in natural gas combustion for heating and power generation.

Ethanol Combustion:
C2H5OH + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O
ΔH = -1367 kJ/mol
Ethanol burns cleanly and is used as a biofuel. The reaction is exothermic and produces only carbon dioxide and water as products.

Propane Combustion:
C3H8 + 5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O
ΔH = -2220 kJ/mol
Propane is commonly used in grills and heating applications. Complete combustion requires sufficient oxygen supply.

ACID-BASE REACTIONS
------------------

Neutralization of Hydrochloric Acid:
HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O
Strong acid + strong base reaction. Products are a salt (sodium chloride) and water. The reaction is highly exothermic.

Acetic Acid with Sodium Bicarbonate:
CH3COOH + NaHCO3 → CH3COONa + H2O + CO2
This reaction produces carbon dioxide gas, making it useful in baking (baking soda + vinegar). The gas production causes bubbling.

Ammonia with Hydrochloric Acid:
NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl
Formation of ammonium chloride salt. This reaction occurs readily in air when ammonia and HCl vapors meet, producing white smoke.

PRECIPITATION REACTIONS
----------------------

Silver Nitrate with Sodium Chloride:
AgNO3 + NaCl → AgCl(s) + NaNO3
Silver chloride precipitates as a white solid. This reaction is used in qualitative analysis to test for chloride ions.

Barium Chloride with Sodium Sulfate:
BaCl2 + Na2SO4 → BaSO4(s) + 2NaCl
Barium sulfate forms a white precipitate that is insoluble in water. Used in medical imaging as a contrast agent.

Lead Nitrate with Potassium Iodide:
Pb(NO3)2 + 2KI → PbI2(s) + 2KNO3
Lead iodide precipitates as a bright yellow solid. This is a classic precipitation reaction demonstration.

REDOX REACTIONS
--------------

Zinc with Hydrochloric Acid:
Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl2 + H2
Zinc is oxidized and hydrogen is reduced. This reaction produces hydrogen gas and is used in some battery systems.

Iron with Copper Sulfate:
Fe + CuSO4 → FeSO4 + Cu
Iron displaces copper from solution. The iron is oxidized and copper is reduced, depositing metallic copper.

Hydrogen Peroxide Decomposition:
2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2
Catalyzed by manganese dioxide or catalase enzyme. This reaction is used in rocket propulsion and biological systems.

REACTION KINETICS NOTES
======================

Temperature Effects:
- Reaction rates typically double for every 10°C temperature increase
- Arrhenius equation: k = A·e^(-Ea/RT)
- Higher temperatures increase molecular kinetic energy and collision frequency

Catalysts:
- Lower activation energy without being consumed
- Provide alternative reaction pathways
- Examples: enzymes (biological), transition metals (industrial)

Concentration Effects:
- Higher concentrations generally increase reaction rates
- Rate laws express mathematical relationship between concentration and rate
- Order of reaction determined experimentally

THERMODYNAMICS NOTES
====================

Enthalpy (ΔH):
- Negative values indicate exothermic reactions (heat released)
- Positive values indicate endothermic reactions (heat absorbed)
- Standard conditions: 25°C, 1 atm pressure

Entropy (ΔS):
- Measure of disorder in the system
- Reactions tend toward increased entropy
- Gas formation typically increases entropy

Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG):
- ΔG = ΔH - TΔS
