MECHANICAL ENGINEERING FORMULAS AND PRINCIPLES
==============================================

STATICS AND DYNAMICS
-------------------

Newton's Laws of Motion:
1st Law: An object at rest stays at rest, an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force
2nd Law: F = ma (Force equals mass times acceleration)
3rd Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction

Equilibrium Conditions:
ΣFx = 0  (Sum of forces in x-direction equals zero)
ΣFy = 0  (Sum of forces in y-direction equals zero)
ΣMz = 0  (Sum of moments about z-axis equals zero)

Moment of a Force:
M = F × d  (Force times perpendicular distance)
M = F × r × sin(θ)  (Force times distance times sine of angle)

Angular Motion:
ω = θ/t  (Angular velocity = angle/time)
α = ω/t  (Angular acceleration = angular velocity/time)
v = ωr   (Linear velocity = angular velocity × radius)
a = αr   (Linear acceleration = angular acceleration × radius)

Rotational Kinetic Energy:
KE = ½Iω²  (where I is moment of inertia)

STRENGTH OF MATERIALS
--------------------

Stress and Strain:
σ = F/A      (Normal stress = force/area)
τ = V/A      (Shear stress = shear force/area)
ε = δ/L      (Strain = deformation/original length)
γ = θ       (Shear strain = angle of deformation)

Hooke's Law:
σ = Eε      (Stress = Elastic modulus × strain)
τ = Gγ      (Shear stress = Shear modulus × shear strain)

Poisson's Ratio:
ν = -εlateral/εaxial

Young's Modulus (Elastic Modulus):
E = σ/ε = (F/A)/(δ/L)

Shear Modulus:
G = τ/γ

Relationship between E, G, and ν:
G = E/[2(1+ν)]

σmax = M/S

Deflection Equations:
For simply supported beam with point load P at center:
δmax = PL³/(48EI)

For cantilever beam with point load P at free end:
δmax = PL³/(3EI)

For simply supported beam with uniform load w:
δmax = 5wL⁴/(384EI)

I = minimum moment of inertia
K = effective length factor
L = actual length

Effective Length Factors (K):
- Both ends pinned: K = 1.0
- Both ends fixed: K = 0.5
- One end fixed, one pinned: K = 0.7
- One end fixed, one free: K = 2.0

Slenderness Ratio:
λ = KL/r  (where r = radius of gyration = √(I/A))

N = A × S^(-m)
where:
N = number of cycles to failure

Endurance Limit (Steel):
Se = 0.5 × Sut  (for Sut ≤ 200 ksi)
Se = 100 ksi    (for Sut > 200 ksi)

where:
σa = alternating stress
σm = mean stress
Se = endurance limit
Sut = ultimate tensile strength

VIBRATIONS

fd = fn × √(1 - ζ²)
where ζ = damping ratio

Critical Damping:
cc = 2√(km)

Damping Ratio:
ζ = c/cc

Transmissibility:
TR = √[(1 + (2ζr)²)/((1-r²)² + (2ζr)²)]
where r = ω/ωn (frequency ratio)
