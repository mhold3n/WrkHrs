## Authentication & Authorization

### API Authentication

The AI Stack implements multiple authentication methods:

1. **API Key Authentication**
   - Use strong, randomly generated API keys
   - Rotate keys regularly (recommended: every 90 days)
   - Store keys securely in environment variables
   - Never commit keys to version control

2. **JWT Token Authentication**
   - Tokens expire after configurable time period (default: 24 hours)
   - Use strong JWT secret keys (minimum 32 characters)
   - Implement proper token refresh mechanisms
   - Validate tokens on every request

### Configuration

```bash
# Strong API key (minimum 32 characters)
API_KEY_SECRET=your-secure-api-key-change-immediately-in-production

# Strong JWT secret (minimum 32 characters)
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secure-jwt-secret-change-immediately-in-production

# Enable authentication
ENABLE_AUTHENTICATION=true

# Rate limiting
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=60
```

### Access Control

- Enable authentication in production (`ENABLE_AUTHENTICATION=true`)
- Implement role-based access control where applicable
- Use principle of least privilege
- Regularly audit access permissions

## Data Privacy & Handling

### Sensitive Data Classification

**Highly Sensitive:**
- Authentication credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Personal identifiable information (PII)
- Proprietary research data
- Financial information

**Moderately Sensitive:**
- Technical specifications
- Internal system configurations
- Business logic details
- User interaction logs

**Public:**
- API documentation
- General system status
- Non-sensitive metadata

### Data Handling Procedures

1. **Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt all sensitive data at rest
   - Use TLS 1.3 for data in transit
   - Implement field-level encryption for highly sensitive data
   - Use strong encryption algorithms (AES-256, RSA-4096)

2. **Data Storage**
   - Store sensitive data in secure, access-controlled locations
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Use secure deletion methods for expired data
   - Regular backups with encryption

3. **Data Processing**
   - Minimize data collection to necessary information only
   - Implement data anonymization where possible
   - Process sensitive data in secure, isolated environments
   - Log data access and processing activities

### Domain-Specific Data Handling

**Chemistry Domain:**
- Chemical formulas and structures: Moderately sensitive
- Experimental data: Highly sensitive
- Safety data sheets: Follow regulatory requirements

## Network Security

### Communication Security

- Use HTTPS/TLS for all external communications
- Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service communication
- Use VPNs for remote access
- Implement network segmentation

### Service Communication

```yaml
# Example secure service configuration
services:
  gateway-api:
    environment:
      - ENABLE_TLS=true
      - TLS_CERT_PATH=/certs/server.crt
      - TLS_KEY_PATH=/certs/server.key
    volumes:
      - ./certs:/certs:ro
```

### Firewall Configuration

- Restrict access to necessary ports only
- Implement ingress and egress filtering
- Use fail2ban for brute force protection
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

## Plugin Security

### Plugin Validation

1. **Code Review**
   - Review all plugin code before deployment
   - Check for malicious or suspicious code
   - Validate input sanitization
   - Ensure proper error handling

2. **Sandboxing**
   - Run plugins in isolated environments
   - Limit system resource access
   - Restrict file system access
   - Control network access

3. **Security Policies**

```python
# Example plugin security configuration
PLUGIN_SECURITY = {
    "sandbox_mode": True,
    "max_memory": "256MB",
    "max_execution_time": 30,
    "allowed_imports": ["math", "json", "re", "datetime"],
    "restricted_operations": [
        "file_system_write",
        "network_access",
        "subprocess",
        "eval",
        "exec"
    ]
}
```

### CLI Tool Wrappers

- Use whitelist approach for allowed commands
- Sanitize all command arguments
- Implement timeout controls
- Log all command executions
- Validate file paths and permissions

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment

```bash
# Development settings
ENVIRONMENT=development
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
ENABLE_AUTHENTICATION=false  # Only for development
ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS=true
```

### Production Environment

```bash
# Production settings
ENVIRONMENT=production
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
ENABLE_AUTHENTICATION=true
ENABLE_DEBUG_ENDPOINTS=false
ENABLE_METRICS=true
ENABLE_JSON_LOGGING=true
```

### Security Headers

Implement security headers in the gateway:

```python
# Security headers
SECURITY_HEADERS = {
    "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
    "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
    "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
    "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
    "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'",
    "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
}
```

## Monitoring & Auditing
